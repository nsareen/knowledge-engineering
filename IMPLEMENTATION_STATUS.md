- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure management with workflow tracking
- **Execution Tracking**: Complete audit trail of agent steps and performance

#### **Specialized Knowledge Extraction Agents**
1. **Concept Extraction Agent**
   - Identifies key concepts and definitions from content
   - Metamodel integration and taxonomy mapping
   - Confidence scoring and deduplication

2. **Entity Recognition Agent**
   - Named entity recognition (PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, etc.)
   - Entity type normalization and attribute extraction
   - Relationship-ready entity structuring

3. **Relationship Mapping Agent**
   - Maps relationships between concepts and entities
   - Network analysis (hubs, density, type distribution)
   - Cross-reference validation with available entities

#### **Knowledge Graph Constructor**
- **End-to-End Integration**: Coordinates all agents in sequence
- **Graph Population**: Automatic Neo4j knowledge graph construction
